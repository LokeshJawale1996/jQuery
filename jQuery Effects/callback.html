    <!-- JavaScript statements are executed line by line. However, 
    with effects, the next line of code can be run even though the effect is not finished. 
    This can create errors.
    
    To prevent this, you can create a callback function.
    
    A callback function is executed after the current effect is finished.
    
    Typical syntax: $(selector).hide(speed,callback); -->
    <h4>
      If we can add some code after effects and add speed of some milliseconds
      in effect then there is chances of executing the code before effect so it
      can create errord to avoid this we can use callback function
